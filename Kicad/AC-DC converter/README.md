This is a basic Ac to Dc converter circuit, that takes in 230v AC as iniput and converts it into 5v dc as output. The flow of conversion is as follows:

230v i/p --> transformer --> bridge rectifier --> voltage regulator --> zener diode --> output

A capacitor is used at the input for coupling and a few intermediate capacitors are used for filtering purposes.


components used:

1. 240 - 12v setp down transformer
2. IN4001 diodes
3.
